# Homebrew cask template for calcyx GUI (.app).
#
# Source-of-truth template kept in the main calcyx repository.
# `scripts/bump-formula.sh <tag>` substitutes the placeholder version /
# sha256 below for the given release tag and writes the result to
# `../homebrew-calcyx/Casks/calcyx.rb`.
#
# Unlike the Formula (which builds CLI from source), this Cask grabs the
# pre-built `.dmg` attached to the GitHub Release, so the dmg must be
# uploaded to the release page before bump-formula.sh can compute the
# correct sha256.
#
# Usage (end users, after the tap is published):
#   brew install --cask ponzu840w/calcyx/calcyx

cask "calcyx" do
  # Placeholders. bump-formula.sh substitutes these per release tag.
